"**Edward Joseph Snowden** (born June 21, 1983) is an American and naturalized Russian citizen who was a computer intelligence consultant and whistleblower who leaked highly classified information from the **National Security Agency (NSA)** in 2013 when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the **NSA** and the **Five Eyes intelligence alliance** with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy."
